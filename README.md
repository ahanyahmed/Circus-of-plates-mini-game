# Circus-of-plates-mini-game
Mini-game by applying OOP principles and design patterns and SOLID principles using JAVA GUI
For Programming 2 final project, I created "Circuit of Plates,"
a mini-game developed using Java GUI and incorporates
advanced programming concepts, including OOP, SOLID
principles, and numerous design patterns. In the game,
plates descend from the sky, and the player-controlled clown
must catch them.
